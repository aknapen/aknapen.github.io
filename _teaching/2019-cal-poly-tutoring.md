During my undergraduate studies, I worked as mathematics tutor in the university's tutoring program. In this role, I worked one-on-one with Cal Poly students as well as younger students in the wider San Luis Obispo community. Subjects I tutored in ranged from elementary and middle school arithmetic to trigonometry, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra. To best handle the wide variety of subject matter, I spent additional time outside of tutoring sessions preparing how best to deliver material for each student's next session.
