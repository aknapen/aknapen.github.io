Course lectures focused on developments in the field of computer architecture, spanning topics like instruction set architectures, pipelining, superscalar and VLIW architectures, branch prediction, speculation, mutliprocessing, and memory hierarchies. The lab component emphasized practice with design and tradeoff analysis, benchmarking, and performing a literature survey in the field of computer architecture. As a graduate teaching assistant, I was responsible for:
1. Presenting course project materials.
2. Assisting students with their assignments and projects during lab sessions.
3. Evaluating and providing feedback on students project reports and end-of-quarter literature surveys.
