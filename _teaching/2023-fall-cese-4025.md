I contributed to redesigning the lab component of the course, including developing new course project material and their associated evaluation rubrics. Within a team of graduate students, I helped implement the projects from scratch in C++, protoype initial printed circuit board (PCB) designs (including many hours of soldering ðŸ˜€), and prepare final PCB design files to be sent to a manufacturer. In the projects, students were tasked with:
1. Developing scheduling algorithms (RM, EDF, FP) within the Zephyr real-time operating system and implementing them on an STM microcontroller.
2. Improving a buggy, high-latency implementation of a synthesizer consisting of a programmable STM microcontroller interfaced with several peripherals (switches, rotary encoders, etc.) on a custom PCB.
