I work as a graduate student instructor (GSI) in my advisor's introduction to quantum computing course. This course covers topics such as
single- and multi-qubit quantum system and circuit representations, phase kickback, quantum algorithms, error correction, and fault-tolerant
quantum computation. As a GSI, I am responsible for:
1. Leading lab lectures for a class of 40 students.
2. Hosting weekly office hours to provide guidance on homeworks and projects, exam preparation, and general course topics.
3. Preparing weekly course material along with another GSI and the faculty instructor.
