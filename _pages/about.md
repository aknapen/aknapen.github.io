I am a second year PhD student and [QRI](https://quantum.umich.edu/) Presidential Graduate fellow in the CSE department at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), advised by [Dr. Gokul Ravi](https://gsravi.engin.umich.edu/). I study computer architecture for quantum computing in the [CAFQA Lab](https://gsravi.engin.umich.edu/cafqa-lab/), where I am developing novel cryogenic hardware designs for quantum error correction decoding. More generally, I am interested in utilizing computer architecture techniques to reduce the classical hardware overheads required for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer engineering and a minor in mathematics at [Cal Poly, SLO](https://www.calpoly.edu/major/computer-engineering). During that time, I also completed internships spanning the computing stack at imec (software), Intel (firmware), and NVIDIA (computer architecture). Subsequently, I obtained my master's degree in computer engineering from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/quantum-computer-engineering) in the Netherlands. For my master's thesis, I developed a hardware microarchitecture implementing a quantum ISA for controlling qubits in diamond NV centers.

Beyond my research, I enjoy many hobbies such as reading, playing drums, running, and playing a variety of sports like tennis and volleyball. On most Saturdays or Sundays, you'll find me supporting my football team, Chelsea FC, and during the World Cup and Euros, the Belgian national team.
